### Hello there ðŸ‘‹ I 'm JosÃ©!!

I'm a full stack developer and civil engineer with a passion for taking on challenges. 
After realizing my interest in the IT world, I decided to dive deep into it. 
I thoroughly enjoy working in teams and collaborating to create exceptional solutions. 
I have hands-on experience with various technologies, including React-Redux, Styled Components, CSS Modules, Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB. 
As I continue to explore this fascinating realm of technology, I am eager to expand my knowledge and skills further. 
Let's keep learning together! ðŸ’ª
